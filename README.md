# PyTorch: An Introduction

### What is PyTorch?

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR). It is widely used for:

- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Reinforcement Learning**

PyTorch provides dynamic computation graphs, making it easier to debug and experiment with deep learning models.

### Why Use PyTorch?

- **Easy to Learn** – Pythonic and simple API
- **Dynamic Computation Graphs** – Unlike TensorFlow’s static graphs
- **Extensive Libraries** – Pre-trained models with torchvision and torchtext
- **Seamless GPU Support** – Built-in CUDA support for faster computations
